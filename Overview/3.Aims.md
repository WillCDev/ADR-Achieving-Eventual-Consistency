# Solution Aims

- We should gain as close to realtime synchronicity between the FE & BE.

- We should be able to roll our solution out in stages, ideally incrementally such that we can keep code changes small.

- We should limit the scope of changes to our API unless doing so is fundamental to achieving a clean and scalable solution.

- We should ideally limit any additional uptime for AWS lambdas such that we do not negate the point of them, or introduce significant cost increases, unless doing so is fundamental to achieving a clean and scalable solution.

- Our solution should be able to scale as our customer base grows and we add additional features/functionality.

- We should aim to reduce coupling between global state and data and simplify our overall approaches to data fetching and state management.

- We should reduce the nesting, prop drilling and overall complexity of the FE codebase.
