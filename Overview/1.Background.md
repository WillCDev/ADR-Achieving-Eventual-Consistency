# Background

> "At Redington/ADA, we utilise Event Sourcing to manage our data. Whilst this comes with many perks, one of the challenges is Eventual Consistency.<br /><br />
> We use Redux and state management to help with this
> in the UI, with every component relying on a FaaC “Container” to bring the relevant “Dispatchers” and
> “Selectors”.<br /><br />
> Whilst this pattern is well established and understood within our codebase, it presents various
> challenges around “fetching status” as well as heavy component nesting."
