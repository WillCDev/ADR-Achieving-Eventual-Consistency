# Proposed Solution: Outstanding Questions

Obviously there is lots of implementation detail that would need to be worked out here. However, at a high level, this approach I believe is clean, scalable, and allows us to implement in an incremental approach and with minimal impact to existing code.

Outstanding questions that I was unable to answer (yet!) include:

- What considerations do we need in terms of Auth? Do we get this for free with our existing AWS API Gateway implementation?

- What considerations do we need to make in terms of tenant domains? Do we need new validation to prevent users from subscribing to updates for entities outside their own tenant domain? Can we reuse validation from the existing service or gateway implementation?

- Is it possible to have the WsHandler function directly subscribe to updates in the View Model / Projection data store, rather than have the Read/View Event Subscriber function have to manually call the WsHandler function? I don't know AWS well enough to answer this at the moment.

- How do we handle subscribing to Lists? Can we update individual entities within lists in the caching layer? Should we address the coupling between data fetching and global state at the same time to address this point? (Probably)

- How do we handle delete events? e.g another user has deleted and entity that I am currently looking at?
