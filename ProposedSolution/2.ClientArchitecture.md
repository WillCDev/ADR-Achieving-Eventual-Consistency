# Proposed Solution: Client Architecture

## WS Sync Module

- Create a standalone (singleton) WsSyncModule.

- WsSyncModule will establish a persistent WS connection with our new WS Sync Route when the client app spins up.

- WsSyncModule will expose a simple callback subscription API
  (obv will need to handle unsubscribe events also)

- API Layer functions (FaaC containers in our case) can subscribe to WsSyncModule with an EntityId (plural?) and a Callback, to trigger a refetch (if required)

- WsSyncmodule will forward this subscription onto the server as a "subscribe" message.

- When WsSyncModule receives a notification from the server, find the relevant CB by EntityId and call it.

<br />

## Required Changes to Existing Code

Changes to existing code will be minimal, and can be done entirely incrementally.

Once the WsSyncModule is built, we can tackle one API container at a time, implementing a small amount of additional functionality along the lines of:

- Do the fetch as normal

- Update the cache as normal

- Create a small callback function that when calls triggers a repeat/refetch of ths above behaviour (NEW)

- Once the initial fetch has completed successfully, subscribe to the WsSyncModule and pass the new callback function + entityId we're subscribing to.

- When the container unmounts, be sure to unsubscribe from WsSyncModule!
