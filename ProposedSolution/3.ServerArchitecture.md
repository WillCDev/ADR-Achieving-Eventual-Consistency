# Proposed Solution: Server Architecture

## WS Connection Subscription Store

- Create a new RDS or DynamoDB data store
- The purpose of this store is to persist information of client WS connections, and the entities that they are subscribed to, it should look something like

| Column       | Type             | Constraints         |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| ConnectionId | AWS ConnectionId | Unique, Primary Key |
| EntityId     | uuid?            | Unique connectionId |

<br />

## WsHandler Function

- Create a new lambda function that will handle both incoming websocket events from API Gateway, as well as handle update events triggered from the Projection layer and notify subscribed clients via the API Gateway.

- Connect the WsHandler function to "WS Connection Subscription Store".

- On Websocket:connect -> do nothing

- On Websocket:message({ type:subscribe }) -> create entry in table with connectionId and entityId if doesn't already exist

- On Websocket:message({ type:unsubscribe }) -> remove entry in table with connectionId and entityId if exists

- On Websocket:disconnect -> remove all entries with matching connectionId

- On HandleUpdate({ entityId }) -> find all entries where entityId, and call API Gateway WS `execute-api` endpoint with the connectionId and entityId for each entry.

<br />

## WS Api Gateway Route

- Expose a new route in API gateway to handle WS connections from the client

- It should call the new WsHandler function on WS events from the client

- It should expose an `execute-api` for the handler to call to respond to the client

<br />

## Required Changes to Existing Code

- Update the Read/View Event Subscriber function to trigger the WSHandler function with the entityId once the View Modal / Projection has been successfully updated.
