# Proposed Solution: Rollout Plan

For the solution so far, the rollout plan I think is actually quite implicit.

At a high level, the work packages would look something like

- BE: Implement WS Connection Subscription Data Store
- BE: Implement WS Handler Function & connect to store
- BE: Add WS Route to Api Gateway and connect to WS Handler function
- BE: Update View Model / Projection controller to call WS Handler function after updates.
- BE: Add Authentication and Validations to the above
- FE: Create WS Sync Module
- FE: Update all relevant data-fetching containers to subscribe to WsSyncModule with refetch callback (This can be done iteratively, one component at a time)
