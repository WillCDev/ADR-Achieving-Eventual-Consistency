# ADR-Achieving-Eventual-Consistency

This technical document is primarily an investigation into how we can achieve eventual consistency between the FE and BE within the Ada platform given the CQRS + Event Sourcing architecture of the BE.

Additionally to address architectural/technical issues within the FE that exist as a consequence of the current design patterns around data fetching, storage and sharing.

## Assumptions

I have assumed that anyone reading this document

- is familiar with the current architecture of the Ada platform
- has a reasonable understanding of the CQRS / Event Sourcing patterns
- understands the resultant issue of eventual consistency when using a decoupled Read Projection as the primary data source for driving the UI within a CQRS / Event Sourcing architecture.
