# Data Synchronisation Solution: Server Wait

> "When the client sends a command, the server won’t return back to the client until the data has been replicated (or projection updated, etc). This means that once the command completes and the client makes a query, they will not get stale data."

### **Pros**:

- We are able to be in sync with the server almost immediately after we perform an update.

### **Cons**:

- Creates a coupling between the write command and the read projection, completely negating the decoupled architecture.
- Introduces potentially large additional delays into update command request/response flow. (UX could be negated using optimistic updates)
- Still doesn't solve the issue concurrent users working on the same entity.

### **Decision**: Nope ❌
