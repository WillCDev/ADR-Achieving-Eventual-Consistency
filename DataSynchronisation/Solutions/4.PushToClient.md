# Data Synchronisation Solution: Push to Client (Webhooks)

## Push to Client (Webhooks)

> "...establish a connection from the client to the server and then have the server push to the client to notify them the replication (or projection) has occurred. At this point, the client can then perform a query to get the latest data"

### **Pros**:

- We are able to be in sync with the server almost immediately after any update is made to the read projection, including that of others.(ish)
- No coupling between read / write layers

### **Cons**:

- ???
- Potentially not possible. See below.

### **Decision**: YES! âœ… ðŸ«£ _(Depending on the below considerations)_

### **Considerations**:

- Can we use websockets with AWS Lambda or do we need a a more traditional service running on e.g EC2?
- Do we need to manage idle connections?
- How will this scale, with many users?
- How does this look on the FE, can we implement in a staged/incremental approach?
