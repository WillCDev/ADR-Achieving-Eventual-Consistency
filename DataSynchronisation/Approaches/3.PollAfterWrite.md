# Approach 3: Client Polling (After Write)

> "Once the client performs its write (command), it then performs the query but understands what the last read (version) was. If the version has not been updated, that means that the replication (or projection) has not been updated and it’s still stale data. The client will wait and then query again until it gets the updated data."

### **Pros**:

- We are able to be in sync with the server almost immediately after we perform an update.(ish)
- No coupling between read / write layers

### **Cons**:

- Requires us to track the version of a given entity in the FE.
- Creates a coupling between the mutation and query code within the FE, could be complex to implement.
- Still doesn't solve the issue concurrent users working on the same entity.

### **Decision**: Nope ❌
