# Approach 2: Read from Primary after Write

> "Once the client sends a command, the following query will be directed towards the primary, not the read replica (or query database)."

### **Pros**:

- We are able to be in sync with the server almost immediately after we perform an update.(ish)

### **Cons**:

- As before, creates a coupling between the write command and the read projection, completely negating the decoupled architecture.
- Unnecessarily complex to synchronise the switch between data targets based on the query.
- Still doesn't solve the issue concurrent users working on the same entity.

### **Decision**: Nope ‚ùå
