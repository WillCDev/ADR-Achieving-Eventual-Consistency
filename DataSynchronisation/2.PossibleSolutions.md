# Data Synchronisation: Possible Solutions

I'm going to hold my hands up here and say I leaned pretty heavily on this article https://codeopinion.com/eventual-consistency-is-a-ux-nightmare/ to get an idea of the high level solution that are out there.

Below I'll evaluate each approach, in the context of our own app:

1. [Server Wait ❌](./Solutions/1.ServerWait.md)
2. [Read from Primary after Write ❌](./Solutions/2.PrimaryRead.md)
3. [Client Polling (After Write) ❌](./Solutions/3.PollAfterWrite.md)
4. [Push to Client (Webhooks) ✅❓](./Solutions/4.PushToClient.md)
5. [Continuous Polling (Pseudo Webhooks) 🤔❓](./Solutions/5.ContinuousPolling.md)
